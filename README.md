# Bank
Above is the details of customers of bank with name xyz. the xyz bank have launched a new service in the bank (eg. edu.loan, buisness loan, home loan etc) AIm: build a Machine learning  model that can predict whether the customer will choose the service or not

Tools and Libraries:
Pandas:Used for data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy:Utilized for numerical operations on data.
Matplotlib and seaborn: Employed for data visualization and creating insightful plots.

**Highlights:**
Data preprocessing : Cleaned and handled null values in the data set

Exploratory Data Analysis: Explored relationships between features and visualized distributions.

Label encoding are performed to change the classified values to numerical values.

Correlation Analysis: Identified and addressed multicollinearity issues.

Outlier Treatment: Applied strategies to handle outliers in numerical features.

Target Variable Transformation: Ensured normality of the target variable through logarithmic transformation.

Feature Selection: Utilized statistical tests to identify significant features.

Model Building: Developed a logistic regression model and assessed its performance.
